# What is PAPR?

The purpose of this informal meeting is to bring together postdocs from the various astrononomy institutes in Pasadena (Carnegie, Caltech Astro/GPS, IPAC, and JPL), and to get to know each other's science. Building on previous years' experience, the retreat is an opportunity to cross institutional boundaries, foster new collaborations, and enrich the experience of being an astronomy postdoc in the City of Astronomy.

This (academic) year's retreat will be held sometimes next spring. The program will include a mix of brief research talks by attendees, and several social gatherings. We will also have invited spakers with academic and non-academic jobs provide career-related perspective and advice, enabling postdocs to explore a variety of career paths.

# When is PAPR 2018?

The 2018 retreat will take place Wednesday afternoon to Friday noon, **May 9-11, 2018**.


We will organize the retreat at the date that works for the more postdocs, pending availability at the conference center.

# Funding

Caltech astronomy and Carnegie will fund 50% of the cost of the retreat for its postdocs, which will correspond to approximately $250. The rest of the funding will have to come from the postdoc's travel funds.
For the other institutions, there is unfortunately no funding available and thus 100% will have to come from the personal travel fund.

# Location

The retreat will be held at the magnificent [UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference Center](http://lakearrowheadconferencecenter.ucla.edu), which is a convenient [2 hour](http://lakearrowheadconferencecenter.ucla.edu/about/directions/) drive from Pasadena. Some say that Lake Arrowhead is the premier mountain resort in the San Bernardino Forest.

# Transportation / carpools

We will set up google spreadsheet to organize carpooling.

# Accommodations and meals

The UCLA conference center will fully [accommodate](http://lakearrowheadconferencecenter.ucla.edu/accommodations/) and [cater](http://lakearrowheadconferencecenter.ucla.edu/dining/) for us. The 'condolets' at the conference center will accommodate two, and offer a queen size bed with bath downstairs and a second queen size bed with bath upstairs. A living room area with wood-burning fireplace is shared by two conferees. All condolets have expansive decks with potential lake or forest views.

The conference center will cater for all meals, which are covered in the cost of the retreat. They will accommodate all dietary requirements detailed during registration.

# Pre-retreat hike

Similar to last year, there will be an optional pre-retreat hike in the morning before we meet at the conference center for the retreat. The [Sawmill Road Loop Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/sawmill-road-loop-trail) is only 3 miles long, features wonderful views, and is just a 5-minute drive from the conference center. More information will follow!

# Program

Program is coming soon

# Talks 

All participants will give informal super-short (and super exciting) presentations on their research. These will be an opportunity for postdocs to develop skills in presenting compelling portraits of their work, and for the audience to learn more about the remarkable science being done around them. The exact format is being determined; please contact the organizing committee if you have any suggestions!

We will also have a few invited speakers who will give talks regarding matters relevant to the postdoc comunity like career advice, the academic job market, and the transition to industry.

List of invited speakers is coming soon
