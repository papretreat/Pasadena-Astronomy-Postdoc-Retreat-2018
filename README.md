# What is PAPR?

The purpose of this informal meeting is to bring together postdocs from the various astrononomy institutes in Pasadena (Carnegie, Caltech Astro/GPS, IPAC, and JPL), and to get to know each other's science. Building on previous years' experience, the retreat is an opportunity to cross institutional boundaries, foster new collaborations, and enrich the experience of being an astronomy postdoc in the City of Astronomy.

This (academic) year's retreat will be held sometimes next spring. The program will include a mix of brief research talks by attendees, and several social gatherings. We will also have invited spakers with academic and non-academic jobs provide career-related perspective and advice, enabling postdocs to explore a variety of career paths.

## Detailed program 

<a href="PAPR2018_schedule(2).pdf">Retreat Program!</a>


## Invited Talks

The invited speakers will give exciting 1h-talk about possible career path and developments that postdocs in astronomy are usually facing! They will share their experience in "typical" faculty-type and scientist-type positions, outreach and communicating with media, and alternative career outside of astronomy.

Our invited spakers are:
- Tiffany Kataria - Scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory
- Farisa Morales - Professor at California State University, Northridge 
- Teagan Wall - Emmy-nominated writer, speaker and science communicator
- Jake Hartman - Software Engineer at Google


## Introduction Talks 

All postdocs will give a 1-minute presentations to introduce themselves and present their research. These will be an opportunity for postdocs to develop skills in presenting compelling portraits of their work, and for the audience to learn more about the remarkable science being done around them. 

## Pre-retreat hike

Similar to last year, there will be an optional pre-retreat hike in the morning before we meet at the conference center for the retreat. The [Sawmill Road Loop Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/sawmill-road-loop-trail) is only 3 miles long, features wonderful views, and is just a 5-minute drive from the conference center. 

Fill in the [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d5grzYo76jLK4t76VM5wbl9XyPsMx03dwn5YkGQGnqk/edit?usp=sharing) to sign up for the hike!
